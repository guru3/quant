### Trading Engine

Following are the components of the trading engine :

- [ ] stock_sym.te ( list of preferred stock symbols )
- [ ] trading_engine.py ( initializes the trading engine )
- [ ] data_engine.py ( to get the data for given symbol for given duration )
- [ ] strategy_ls.te ( list of strategies )
